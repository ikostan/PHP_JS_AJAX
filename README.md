1. A file named showtable.html and a companion PHP file named showtab.php. Users will be able to use your files to show the contents of the table of their choice (viz customers, orders, order_items, books, book_reviews). Show all fields in the selected table. 

2. A file named showprice.html and a companion PHP file named showpric.php. Users will be able to use your files to show the contents of the book table filtered according to the price of each book. One important feature of your web application will be to allow the user to specify a search price in dollars AND also specify if the books returned should be above OR below the search price entered. Show all fields in the book table. 

3. A file named showcustomer.html and a companion PHP file named showcust.php. Users will be able to use your files to search for a specific customer according to his/her telephone number (hint: you will need to add phone numbers to your database first). Show all fields in the customer table
